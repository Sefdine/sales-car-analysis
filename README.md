## Objective

The project aims to implement a data pipeline for car sales data analysis, ultimately providing informed car purchasing advice.

## Scope

The project encompasses the following phases:

- Data source targeting
- Data processing
- Modeling and storage
- Visualization and analysis

## Methodologies

The project follows SCRUM and CRISP-DM methodologies for efficient development and data analysis.

## Data Requirements

### Sources:

1. **DVM-CAR**: Large-scale automotive application dataset.
2. **Marketcheck**: Market data for researchers and developers.

## Technical Requirements

### Data Processing:

- **GDPR Compliance**: Transformations adhere to GDPR standards and Moroccan law 09-08.
- **Programming Language**: Python is chosen for its popularity and community support.
- **Data Staging**: HDFS used as a staging area for raw data.
- **Data Warehouse**: SQL Server employed for the data warehouse.
- **Pipeline Orchestration**: Airflow optimizes the pipeline in batch and real-time.
- **Visualization**: Power BI used for analyses and visualizations.
- **Environment Configuration**: Docker simplifies environment setup and deployment.
- **Version Control**: Git/Github for version control.
- **CI/CD**: Github Actions ensure continuous integration and deployment.

## Constraints and Limitations

### Timelines:
